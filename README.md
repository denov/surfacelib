The surfaceLib gives you an easy way to create different 3d surfaces in processing.

To understand the math behind the different surfaces take a look
at [Paul Bourkes](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/) surface site,
which was the main source for the math stuff.

If you create new surface it would be nice if you send me the source so I can add them to the library.

You can also add your own surface implementation, following this [short tutorial](https://github.com/eskimoblood/surfacelib/wiki/How-to-create-your-own-surface-class).

The library is created to work with processing 2.0 and higher.
